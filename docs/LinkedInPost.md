What if news had no opinions?

Two sources. Different owners. Strip the adjectives. State the facts. Stop.

JTF News is an experiment in automated journalism that reports only verified facts. No opinions. No adjectives. No interpretation.

This is not journalism. It is data.

THE METHODOLOGY
• Minimum two independent sources with different ownership
• AI strips all adjectives and editorialization
• Official titles only ("President Biden" not "Biden")
• No engagement—we publish once, never reply

WHY IT MATTERS
In an era of declining trust in media, we asked: what if a news source was so boring, so stripped of drama, that you could trust every word?

The methodology belongs to no one. It serves everyone.
