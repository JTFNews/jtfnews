JTF News - 24/7 Automated Fact-Only News

Two sources. Different owners. Strip the adjectives. State the facts. Stop.

No opinions. No adjectives. No interpretation. Verified facts from two independent sources.

This is not journalism. It is data.

THE RULES:
• Two unrelated sources minimum (different owners, different investors)
• AI strips all adjectives and editorialization
• Official titles only
• No engagement—we report once, never reply

The methodology belongs to no one. It serves everyone.
